# Intentionally Absent

The following projects are not part of this roundup.  Here's why.

- Sancho UI
  - [Sancho UI](https://sancho-ui.com/) is a fork of [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/) that hasn't kept up well with Evergreen itself.  It's a cool project, for sure, but for the purposes of this roundup it doesn't vary enough from Evergreen to be useful to include.
